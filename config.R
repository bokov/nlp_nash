#### inputdata ####
#'
#' The inputdata variable determines which data files will get read into your
#' project. The values are the file locations and the names are the variables
#' to which they will be assigned after they are read into R
#'
#' In the `config.R` file there should only be simulations of your actual data
#' or datasets that you are _certain_ you have permission to redistribute
#' publicly.
#'
#' If there is also a `local.config.R` file, that one will override `config.R`
#' and that one can contain paths to actual data, presumably on each
#' collaborator's local computer.
inputdata <- c(
  dat01 = 'simulation of ENRICHed List - NASH_1_3.1578502159.0543473.xlsx'
);

#### global options ####
#' There is no need to repeat these options in `local.config.R` unless for some
#' reason you only need to override them locally. Otherwise, these options
#' will propagate throughout the project
options(datatable.integer64='character');
