Notes for NLP NASH Paper

* From Van Vleck et al 2019: We then applied the CLiX clinical NLP engine produced by Clinithink (see Appendix for more information) to this cohort, an algorithm recently demonstrated to be useful in patient phenotyping [16]. CLiX is a general-purpose stochastic parser, which maps patient facts described in clinical narrative to post-coordinated SNOMED expressions, thereby creating a highly descriptive, standardized data layer capturing all identified clinical facts across domains and clinical contexts [17]. 
* How many chart reviewers were there? One or two?
